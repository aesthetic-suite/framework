## Reporting a vulnerability

If you find a dependency vulnerability that is not covered by Dependabot, please either submit a
pull request with the dependency updated/resolved, or create an issue detailing the vulnerability,
preferably with an external report.

If a code vulnerability, please create an issue with a thorough explanation, preferably with a code
example to reproduce with. An associated pull request with a fix is also welcome.
