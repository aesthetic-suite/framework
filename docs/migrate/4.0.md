## React utilites have moved to their own package

All React functionality and utilities have moved to the new `aesthetic-react` package. This
primarily includes the hook and HOC helpers.

```tsx
// Old
import React from 'react';
import aesthetic from './aesthetic';

function Button({ props, styles }) {
  return <button />;
}

export default aesthetic.withStyles(theme => ({
  button: {
    padding: theme.unit,
  },
}))(Button);
```

```tsx
// New
import React from 'react';
import { withStylesFactory } from 'aesthetic-react';
import aesthetic from './aesthetic';

const withStyles = withStylesFactory(aesthetic);

function Button({ props, styles }) {
  return <button />;
}

export default withStyles(theme => ({
  button: {
    padding: theme.unit,
  },
}))(Button);
```

This new factory pattern has been applied to all hooks and HOCs, so be sure to read the new
[React integration docs](../integrations/react.md).
