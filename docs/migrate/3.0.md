# 3.0 Migration

This release included a major rewrite to TypeScript in an effort to design a type-safe CSS-in-JS
library. To accomplish this, syntax and features had to change.

> This migration guide is not exhaustive and only includes major changes, so please refer to the
> [official changelog](https://github.com/milesj/aesthetic/blob/master/packages/core/CHANGELOG.md)
> for other changes.

## Adapters now extend from Aesthetic

Adapters are no longer passed to `Aesthetic`'s constructor -- instead, they now extend `Aesthetic`
directly and can be instantiated as is. Furthermore, adapters that require native instances must now
be explicitly passed.

```ts
// Old
const aphrodite = new Aesthetic(new AphroditeAdapter());

const cssModules = new Aesthetic(new CSSModulesAdapter());

const fela = new Aesthetic(new FelaAdapter());

const jss = new Aesthetic(new JSSAdapter());

const typeStyle = new Aesthetic(new TypeStyleAdapter());

// New
const aphrodite = new AphroditeAesthetic(extensions);

const cssModules = new CSSModulesAesthetic();

const fela = new FelaAesthetic(createRenderer());

const jss = new JSSAesthetic(create());

const typeStyle = new TypeStyleAesthetic(new TypeStyle({ autoGenerateTag: true }));
```

## Unified syntax is now the default

Supporting both adapter native syntax (Aphrodite, JSS, etc) and unified syntax (Aesthetic) in unison
was not possible with a type-safe system. Since Aesthetic exists to bridge the gap between
third-party libraries and CSS-in-JS adapters, the best course of action was to make unified syntax
the only supported syntax.

```ts
// Old
import Aesthetic from 'aesthetic';
import FelaAdapter from 'aesthetic-adapter-fela/unified';

const aesthetic = new Aesthetic(new FelaAdapter());

// New
import { createRenderer } from 'fela';
import FelaAesthetic from 'aesthetic-adapter-fela';

const aesthetic = new FelaAesthetic(createRenderer());
```

> The "aesthetic-adapter-\*/unified" import path has been removed from all adapters.

## Unified syntax at-rules has changed

Global at-rule `@namespace` has been removed, as it was rarely supported by adapters, and didn't
provide much functionality.

Additionally, global at-rules `@charset`, `@import`, `@font-face`, `@global`, `@keyframes`, `@page`,
and `@viewport` must now be defined in the global stylesheet when registering a theme. The font
family name and keyframes name can still be referenced by name as before.

```ts
// Old
withStyles(() => ({
  '@import': './some/styles.css',
  '@font-face': {
    Roboto: [{ srcPaths: ['./fonts/Roboto.woff2'] }],
  },
  '@keyframes': {
    fade: {
      from: { opacity: 0 },
      to: { opacity: 1 },
    },
  },
}));

// New
aesthetic.registerTheme('default', {}, () => ({
  '@import': './some/styles.css',
  '@font-face': {
    Roboto: [{ srcPaths: ['./fonts/Roboto.woff2'] }],
  },
  '@keyframes': {
    fade: {
      from: { opacity: 0 },
      to: { opacity: 1 },
    },
  },
}));
```

> Font faces and keyframes can also be defined within a component by using
> [property objects](../unified/properties.md).

Inversely, local at-rules `@fallbacks`, `@media`, and `@supports` must now be defined in a component
stylesheet using the `withStyles` HOC.

```ts
// Old
aesthetic.registerTheme(
  'default',
  {},
  {
    '@media': {
      '(max-width: 300)': {
        fontSize: 16,
      },
    },
  },
);

// New
aesthetic.withStyles(() => ({
  element: {
    fontSize: 18,

    '@media': {
      '(max-width: 300)': {
        fontSize: 16,
      },
    },
  },
}))(Component);
```

## Advanced selectors must now be nested in `@selectors`

CSS selectors are not type-safe by design as there can be an infinite number of permutations, which
is impossible to type with a type system. At best, all CSS styles would be typed as `any`, which
defeats the purpose of a type system.

To mitigate this, Aesthetic implements [csstype](https://github.com/frenic/csstype) to support all
standard pseudo selectors and HTML attributes. This works for basic selectors that are not combined
with other selectors, but does not work for advanced selectors. To safely support advanced
selectors, they must now be nested within `@selectors`.

```ts
// Old
withStyles(() => ({
  link: {
    color: 'blue',

    ':hover': {
      color: 'red',
    },

    ':not(:hover)': {
      color: 'yellow',
    },

    '[href*="foo"]': {
      color: 'green',
    },
  },
}));

// New
aesthetic.withStyles(() => ({
  link: {
    color: 'blue',

    ':hover': {
      color: 'red',
    },

    '@selectors': {
      ':not(:hover)': {
        color: 'yellow',
      },

      '[href*="foo"]': {
        color: 'green',
      },
    },
  },
}));
```

## Styler creation has been removed

The `createStyler` function has been removed. Use the `Aesthetic#withStyles` (HOC factory) and
`Aesthetic#transformStyles` (class name transformer) methods instead. We suggest wrapping these
methods in helper functions for usability.

```ts
// Old
const { style, transform } = createStyler(aesthetic);

style(() => ({}))(Component);
transform(styles.foo, styles.bar);

// New
aesthetic.withStyles(() => ({}))(Component);
aesthetic.transformStyles(styles.foo, styles.bar);
```

## `withStyles` now only accepts a function

The old implementation accepted a stylesheet object or a function that returned a stylesheet object.
The new implementation only accepts a function that returns a stylesheet object.

```ts
// Old
withStyles({
  button: {},
})(Component);

// New
aesthetic.withStyles(() => ({
  button: {},
}))(Component);
```

## `withStyles` is no longer passed current component props

Current component props are no longer passed as the 2nd argument to the styler function. This
functionality can be handled with the `Aesthetic#transformStyles` method within the component's
render path.

```tsx
// Old
withStyles((theme, props) => ({
  wrapper: {
    width: '100%',
    margin: props.gutter,
  },
}))(Component);

// New
function Component({ children, styles, gutter }) {
  return <div className={css(styles.wrapper, { margin: gutter })}>{children}</div>;
}

export default withStyles(() => ({
  wrapper: {
    width: '100%',
  },
}))(Component);
```

> The `css` function is simply a wrapper function around `Aesthetic#transformStyles`.

## Theme layer has changed

The old theme layer was built around React legacy context, a custom `ThemeProvider` component, and a
lot of cruft. Furthermore, themes could change per component using a `themeName` prop.

```tsx
// Old
const aesthetic = new Aesthetic({ defaultTheme: 'default' });

aesthetic.registerTheme(
  'default',
  { unit: 8 },
  {
    '@global': {
      body: {
        fontSize: 16,
      },
    },
  },
);

<ThemeProvider name="default">
  <App>
    <Button themeName="dark">Example</Button>
  </App>
</ThemeProvider>;
```

The new theme layer has been rewritten to be dead simply. No more React context or `ThemeProvider`,
simply pass the active theme to the `Aesthetic` instance. However, this new system does not support
themeing per component, as it was quite impossible to avoid global style collision.

```tsx
// New
const aesthetic = new JSSAesthetic(jss, { theme: 'default' });

aesthetic.registerTheme('default', { unit: 8 }, () => ({
  '@global': {
    body: {
      fontSize: 16,
    },
  },
}));

<App>
  <Button>Example</Button>
</App>;
```
