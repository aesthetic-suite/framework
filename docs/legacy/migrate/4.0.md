# 4.0 Migration

To support other frameworks besides React, and more advanced features, the following changes have
been made.

> This migration guide is not exhaustive and only includes large changes, so please refer to the
> [official changelog](https://github.com/milesj/aesthetic/blob/master/packages/core-legacy/CHANGELOG.md)
> for other changes.

## Core

### API method renames

To better align our terminology, the following API methods have been renamed.

- `Aesthetic#setStyleSheet` has been renamed to `registerStyleSheet`, to align with registering
  themes.
- `Aesthetic#processStyleSheet` has been renamed to `parseStyleSheet`, to align with the adapter
  concept of parsing native blocks into parsed blocks.

### Pure option has been removed

The `pure` option passed to `Aesthetic` and `withStyles` has been removed in favor of functional
components under the hood.

```ts
// Before
new Aesthetic({ pure: true });
withStyles({ pure: true })(Component);

// After
new Aesthetic();
withStyles()(Component);
```

### Styles can no longer be spread

The `Aesthetic#transformStyles` method that generates CSS class names from parsed styles, has been
updated to requires all styles to be passed as an array to the 1st argument, instead of being spread
through many arguments. This change was made to support future options objects.

```ts
// Old
const className = aesthetic.transformStyles(styles.foo, var && styles.bar);

// New
const className = aesthetic.transformStyles([styles.foo, var && styles.bar]);
```

> This does not change the `cx` function, which still accepts spreading.

## React

### Moved to a new package

All React functionality and utilities have moved to the new `aesthetic-react` package, and off of
the `Aesthetic` instance. This primarily includes the hook and HOC helpers.

```tsx
// Old
import React from 'react';
import aesthetic from './aesthetic';

function Button({ props, styles }) {
  return <button />;
}

export default aesthetic.withStyles((theme) => ({
  button: {
    padding: theme.unit,
  },
}))(Button);
```

```tsx
// New
import React from 'react';
import { withStylesFactory } from 'aesthetic-react';
import aesthetic from './aesthetic';

const withStyles = withStylesFactory(aesthetic);

function Button({ props, styles }) {
  return <button />;
}

export default withStyles((theme) => ({
  button: {
    padding: theme.unit,
  },
}))(Button);
```

This new factory pattern has been applied to all hooks and HOCs, so be sure to read the new
[React integration docs](../integrations/react.md).

### Class name transformer is now passed as a prop

The function to transform parsed styles into CSS class names, commonly referred to as `cx` or `css`,
is now passed as prop named `cx` when using `withStyles`. Previously this function was factoried and
imported separately.

No changes are required for `useStyles`, since the `cx` function was already returned as the 2nd
tuple value.

```tsx
// Old
import React from 'react';
import withStyles from './withStyles';
import cx from './cx';

function Button({ props, styles }) {
  return <button className={cx(styles.button)} />;
}

export default withStyles((theme) => ({
  button: {
    padding: theme.unit,
  },
}))(Button);
```

```tsx
// New
import React from 'react';
import withStyles from './withStyles';

function Button({ props, cx, styles }) {
  return <button className={cx(styles.button)} />;
}

export default withStyles((theme) => ({
  button: {
    padding: theme.unit,
  },
}))(Button);
```

> The name of this prop can be customized with the `cxPropName` option.

### Renamed interface types

The `WithStylesProps` and `WithThemeProps` interfaces were renamed to `WithStylesWrappedProps` and
`WithThemeWrappedProps` respectively. `WithStylesWrappedProps` also requires the native block type
to be passed from the adapter.

```ts
// Old
import {
  WithStylesProps as BaseWithStylesProps,
  WithThemeProps as BaseWithThemeProps,
} from 'aesthetic';
import { ParsedBlock } from 'aesthetic-adapter-aphrodite';
import { Theme } from './aesthetic';

export type WithStylesProps = BaseWithStylesProps<Theme, ParsedBlock>;
export type WithThemeProps = BaseWithThemeProps<Theme>;
```

```ts
// New
import { WithStylesWrappedProps, WithThemeWrappedProps } from 'aesthetic-react';
import { NativeBlock, ParsedBlock } from 'aesthetic-adapter-aphrodite';
import { Theme } from './aesthetic';

export type WithStylesProps = WithStylesWrappedProps<Theme, NativeBlock, ParsedBlock>;
export type WithThemeProps = WithThemeWrappedProps<Theme>;
```
