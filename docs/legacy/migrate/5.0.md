# 5.0 Migration

To improve interoperability, the `Aesthetic` instance is now global and no longer needs to be
instantiated.

## Core

### Aesthetic is now a global instance

Historically, Aesthetic was powered by a class instance that needed to be passed around for styling
and functionality to operate. It was built this way for isolation and for multiple adapters to be
ran in parallel. However, in practice this is not the case, as 1 adapter was only ever used, and
passing this instance around was quite cumbersome.

Moving forward, Aesthetic is now a single global instance, found at the default export of the
`aesthetic` package. To support this change, adapters no longer extend the base `Aesthetic` class,
but now extend an `Adapter` class. The adapter and Aesthetic specific options must now be configured
through the new `Aesthetic#configure()` method, like so.

```ts
// Before
import AphroditeAesthetic from 'aesthetic-adapter-aphrodite';

const aesthetic = new AphroditeAesthetic([], { rtl: true, theme: 'dark' });
```

```ts
// After
import aesthetic from 'aesthetic';
import AphroditeAdapter from 'aesthetic-adapter-aphrodite';

aesthetic.configure({
  adapter: new AphroditeAdapter([]),
  rtl: true,
  theme: 'dark',
});
```

If an adapter is not configured, Aesthetic default's to the `ClassNameAdapter`, which only accepts
CSS class names as strings.

### Theme type no longer provided via generics (TS)

Since Aesthetic is now global and we do not instantiate an instance, we cannot pass the `Theme`
generic to the constructor. For the most part, we lost quite a bit of automatic theme typing, which
is unfortunate. However, most methods and type aliases support a `Theme` generic, allowing similar
functionality to the previous implementation.

```ts
// Before
import AphroditeAesthetic from 'aesthetic-adapter-aphrodite';
import { Theme } from './types';

const aesthetic = new AphroditeAesthetic<Theme>();

aesthetic.registerTheme('light', {});
aesthetic.registerStyleSheet('button', ({ unit }) => ({}));
```

```ts
// After
import aesthetic from 'aesthetic';
import { Theme } from './types';

aesthetic.registerTheme<Theme>('light', {});
aesthetic.registerStyleSheet<Theme>('button', ({ unit }) => ({}));
```

### API method changes

The following methods have moved from the `Aesthetic` class to a new `Adapter` class:
`applyGlobalStyles`, `createStyleSheet`, `flushStyles`, `isParsedBlock`, `parseStyleSheet`,
`purgeStyles`, and `transformStyles`. The configured adapter can be accessed using
`Aesthetic#getAdapter()`.

```ts
// Before
const styles = aesthetic.createStyleSheet('button-component');

aesthetic.flushStyles('button-component');
```

```ts
// After
const adapter = aesthetic.getAdapter();
const styles = adapter.createStyleSheet('button-component');

adapter.flushStyles('button-component');
```

## React

### Hooks and HOCs are no longer factories

With Aesthetic being moved to a global instance, the hook and HOC factories are no longer necessary,
as we can infer the Aesthetic instance automatically now.

```tsx
// Before
import React from 'react';
import { StyleSheetDefinition } from 'aesthetic';
import { useStylesFactory } from 'aesthetic-react';
import aesthetic from './aesthetic';
import { Theme } from './types';

const useStyles = useStylesFactory(aesthetic);

const styleSheet: StyleSheetDefinition<Theme> = (theme) => ({
  button: {},
});

export default function Button() {
  const [styles, cx] = useStyles(styleSheet);

  return <button type="button" className={cx(styles.button)} />;
}
```

```tsx
// After
import React from 'react';
import { StyleSheetFactory } from 'aesthetic';
import { useStyles } from 'aesthetic-react';
import { Theme } from './types';

const styleSheet: StyleSheetFactory<Theme> = (theme) => ({
  button: {},
});

export default function Button() {
  const [styles, cx] = useStyles(styleSheet);

  return <button type="button" className={cx(styles.button)} />;
}
```

### Providers no longer require an Aesthetic instance

The `aesthetic` prop has been removed from `DirectionProvider` and `ThemeProvider`.

```tsx
// Before
<ThemeProvider aesthetic={aesthetic} name="dark">
  <App />
</ThemeProvider>
```

```tsx
// After
<ThemeProvider name="dark">
  <App />
</ThemeProvider>
```
