# Brand

> Platforms: Android, iOS, Web

Brand drives every single decision you make when building new products or features. It's the values
that define your unique identity, what makes you stand out from others, and can be configured
through the `.aesthetic/<name>/brand.yaml` file.

> Aesthetic currently does not configure many brand settings. Support for this is on the roadmap.

## Name

What is a brand without a name? The name should be unique across all possible design systems.

```yaml
name: Aesthetic 2020
```
