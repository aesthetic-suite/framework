# Structured Style Sheets

Structured style sheets (SSS) are a strict, type-safe, and structure-safe CSS-in-JS style sheet
format. It's a specification that provides a global style sheet for handling document level at-rules
and global-like styles, and a local style sheet for handling isolated component level at-rules and
styles.
