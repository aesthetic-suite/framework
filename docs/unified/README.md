# Unified Syntax

Aesthetic provides an optional unified CSS-in-JS syntax. This unified syntax permits easy
[drop-in replacements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drop-in_replacement) between adapters that
utilize CSS-in-JS objects, as well as a standard across libraries.

**Pros**

- Easily swap between CSS-in-JS adapters (for either performance or extensibility reasons) without
  having to rewrite all CSS style object syntax.
- Third-party UI libraries can define their styles using the unified syntax, while consumers can
  choose their preferred adapter.
- Third-party UI libraries can standardize on a single syntax for interoperability.
- Only have to learn one form of syntax.

**Cons**

- Slight overhead (like milliseconds) converting the unified syntax to the adapters native syntax.
  However, Aesthetic caches heavily.
- Must learn a new form of syntax (hopefully the last one).

**Why a new syntax?**

While implementing adapters and writing tests for all their syntax and use cases, I noticed that all
adapters shared about 90-95% of the same syntax. That remaining percentage could easily be
abstracted away by a library, and hence, this unified syntax was created.

Furthermore, a unified syntax allows providers of third-party components to define their styles in a
standard way with consumers having the choice of their preferred adapter.

**Why a different at-rule structure?**

The major difference between the unified syntax and native adapters syntax, is that at-rules in the
unified syntax are now multi-dimensional objects indexed by the name of the at-rule (`@media`),
while at-rules in the native syntax are single objects indexed by the at-rule declaration
(`@media (min-width: 100px)`).

Supporting the native syntax incurred an linear (`O(n)`) lookup, as we would have to loop through
each object recursively to find all at-rules, while the unified syntax is a simple constant (`O(1)`)
lookup as we know the names ahead of time. This constant time lookup is what enables a fast
conversion process between the unified and native syntaxes.

**How do I enable the unified syntax?**

Please refer to the readme of your chosen adapter.
