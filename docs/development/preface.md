# Preface

All of the development documentation pertains to a web based CSS-in-JS solution. If you're using
another platform or format, you can skip this section entirely.

If using the CSS-in-JS solution, you'll come across code examples that import from
`@aesthetic/core`. This module _should_ be replaced with your integration of choice. For example, if
you're using React, you should import from `@aesthetic/react` instead.
