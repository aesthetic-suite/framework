# Getting started

Begin by installing Aesthetic, React, and ReactDOM.

```bash
yarn add @aesthetic/react react react-dom
```

If you're using TypeScript, also install required types.

```bash
yarn add --dev @types/react @types/react-dom
```

Once installed, we suggest [configuring Aesthetic](../../development/configure.md) itself.
