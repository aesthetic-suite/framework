# React

The React integration provides a bridge between Aesthetic core and [React](https://reactjs.org/)
itself. It enables components to easily and fluently style themselves with design tokens compiled by
a design system.

- [Getting started](./setup.md)
- [Using themes](./themes.md)
- [Styling components](./styles.md)
- [Directionality](./direction.md)
- [API](./api.md)

## Features

- Hook and HOC based APIs for styling components, accessing themes, and handling directionality.
- Global, document, and element level themes powered through context.
- Nested themes that avoid polluting the global scope.
- First-class directionality support (RTL, LTR).

## Requirements

- React 16.6+
