# Design system

A design system is the single source of truth for a product or companies visual identity. With
Aesthetic, the design system is structured around the following 3 pillars.

```
+----------------- Design System -------------------+
| +-------------+ +-------------+ +---------------+ |
| | Brand       | | Language    | | Themes        | |
| +-------------+ +-------------+ +---------------+ |
| | Vision      | | Borders     | | Colors        | |
| | Principles  | | Elevation   | | Color schemes | |
| | Terminology | | Iconography | | Palettes      | |
| | Guidelines  | | Motion      | | States        | |
| +-------------+ | Responsive  | | Contrast      | |
|                 | Spacing     | | Accessibility | |
|                 | Typography  | +---------------+ |
|                 +-------------+                   |
+---------------------------------------------------+

## Brand

Brand is much more than a name and a logo. Itâ€™s the values that define your unique identity and what
makes you stand out from others. This is represented by an overarching vision, accompanying design
principles, guidelines, and more.

## Language

The visual aspects of a design system is known as a design language, and is divided into the
following categories:

- **Borders** - Border widths and rounding.
- **Elevation** - Shadows and depths.
- **Iconography** - _(Coming soon)_
- **Motion** - _(Coming soon)_
- **Responsive/Adaptive** - Breakpoints, strategies, and scaling.
- **Spacing** - Spacing algorithms and multipliers.
- **Typography** - Text/heading fonts, sizing, and letter spacing.

## Themes

You may have noticed the absence of color mentioned in language, as color is a very important
feature of a product's visual identity. That's because in an Aesthetic design system, color is
managed by themes!

[themes](./themes.md) chapter.
