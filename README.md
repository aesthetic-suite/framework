# Aesthetic
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/milesj/aesthetic.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/milesj/aesthetic)

Aesthetic is a powerful React library for styling components, whether it be CSS-in-JS
using style objects, importing stylesheets, or simply referencing external class names.
Simply put, Aesthetic is an abstraction layer that utilizes higher-order-components for
the compilation of styles via third-party libraries, all the while providing customizability,
theming, and a unified syntax.

* React 15/16+
* IE 10+
* `WeakMap`
