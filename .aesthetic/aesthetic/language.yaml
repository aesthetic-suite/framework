# Guidelines
#   - All unit based settings should be defined as unitless numbers.
#     Assume "px" for web, "sp" or "dp" for Android, and "pt" for iOS.

# RESPONSIVE
responsive:
  # A list of 5 breakpoint units to target for device sizes.
  breakpoints:
    - 640
    - 960
    - 1280
    - 1600
    - 1920

  # Scaling factor to modify the text and line height for each breakpoint.
  textScale: minor-second
  lineHeightScale: minor-second

# SPACING
spacing:
  # The type of algorithm to use when calculating spacing and measurement tokens.
  # Accepts "vertical-rhythm" or "unit".
  type: vertical-rhythm

  # The base unit size when type is "unit".
  unit: 8

  # Multipliers for each spacing size.
  multipliers:
    xs: 0.25
    sm: 0.5
    df: 1 # Default
    md: 2
    lg: 3
    xl: 4

# TYPOGRAPHY
typography:
  # Font family for all body text and headings. Defaults to the platform "system" font.
  # Can customize text, heading, monospace, and locale fonts individually by using a map.
  font: system

  # Default text sizes and line heights, with "small" and "large" sizes being automatically
  # calculated using modular scale. The default text size is used as the "root font size".
  # Can customize default, small, and large sizes individually by using a map.
  text:
    size: 14
    sizeScale: major-second
    lineHeight: 1.25
    lineHeightScale: 0

  # Level 6 heading size, line height, and letter spacing. Levels 5-1 are automatically
  # calculated by incrementing upwards using module scale.
  # Can customize each level individually by using a map.
  heading:
    size: 16
    sizeScale: major-third
    lineHeight: 1.5

# BORDERS
# Scales from the inside (default) out (small, large). Configure for default.
# Can customize small, default, and large sizes individually by using a map.
borders:
  # Controls the rounding of corners.
  radius: 3
  radiusScale: 1.5

  # Controls the width or thickness of the border.
  width: 1
  widthScale: 2

# SHADOWS
# Scales from extra small to extra large. Configure for extra small.
# Can customize all sizes individually by using a map.

  # Offset the shadow on the X-axis (horizontally).
  x: 0
  xScale: 0

  # Offset the shadow on the Y-axis (vertically).
  y: 2
  yScale: golden-ratio

  # Controls blur and reduces sharpness, which causes it to be bigger and lighter.
  blur: 2
  blurScale: 1.75

  # Controls spread, which causes it to expand, grow, and get thicker.
  spread: 0
