# Guidelines
#   - All unit based settings should be defined as unitless numbers.
#     Assume "px" for web, "sp" or "dp" for Android, and "pt" for iOS.

# RESPONSIVE
responsive:
  # A list of 5 breakpoint units to target for device sizes.
  breakpoints:
    xs: 640
    sm: 960
    md: 1280
    lg: 1600
    xl: 1920

  # Scaling factor to modify the text and line height for each breakpoint.
  textScale: minor-second
  lineHeightScale: minor-second

# SPACING
spacing:
  # The type of algorithm to use when calculating spacing and measurement tokens.
  # Accepts "vertical-rhythm" or "unit".
  type: vertical-rhythm

  # The base unit size when type is "unit".
  unit: 8

# TYPOGRAPHY
