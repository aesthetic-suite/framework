[View the migration guide!](https://github.com/milesj/aesthetic/blob/master/docs/migrate/4.0.md)

#### 💥 Breaking

- React hooks, HOCs, and types have moved to the new
  [aesthetic-react](https://github.com/milesj/aesthetic/tree/master/packages/react) package.
- Helper functions have moved to the new
  [aesthetic-utils](https://github.com/milesj/aesthetic/tree/master/packages/utils) package.
- Updated `Aesthetic#transformStyles` to require all styles as an array in the 1st argument, instead
  of being spread across all arguments.
- Updated `Aesthetic#transformToClassName` to only be passed the parsed blocks and not the native
  adapter blocks.
- Renamed `Aesthetic#setStyleSheet` to `registerStyleSheet`.
- Renamed `Aesthetic#processStyleSheet` to `parseStyleSheet`.
- Removed the `pure` option (since class components are no longer used).

#### 🚀 Updates

- Added built-in RTL support for _all_ adapters!
- Added a new tagged caching layer that supports multiple themes and directions in parallel!
- Added a `cxPropName` option to `Aesthetic`.
- Added a `rtl` option to `Aesthetic`.
- Added `Aesthetic#changeTheme`, so that the theme can be dynamically changed without having to
  refresh the page (integration dependent).
- Added `Aesthetic#isParsedBlock` for determining whether a style block is native or parsed.
- Added `Aesthetic#purgeStyles`, so that adapters can clear their style sheets.
- Added an options object to `Aesthetic#createStyleSheet`, `Aeshetic#transformStyles`,
  `UnifiedSyntax#convertGlobalSheet`, `UnifiedSyntax#convertStyleSheet`, and `Sheet`.
- Updated `Aeshetic#transformStyles` to convert native blocks to parsed blocks before transforming
  to CSS class names.
- Updated `Sheet` (and `Ruleset`) to convert CSS properties to RTL when the direction option is
  enabled.

## 3.5.0 - 2019-04-28

- Fixed an issue in which global styles weren't flushing for some adapters.

# 3.0.0 - 2019-01-28

Aesthetic has been rewritten in TypeScript, and as such, many existing patterns were not type safe
and had to be refactored. With this rewrite comes a new adapter layer, easier theme layer, removal
of stylers, and unified syntax as the default.

[View the migration guide!](https://github.com/milesj/aesthetic/blob/master/docs/migrate/3.0.md)

#### 💥 Breaking

**Core**

- Dropped support for Glamor and the `aesthetic-adapter-glamor` package.
- Dropped support for style objects passed directly to `withStyles`. Styles must now be a definition
  function that returns an object.
- Dropped support for current props passed as the 2nd argument to the `withStyles` styling function.
  This pattern was non-deterministic and caused cache invalidation issues.
- Removed the `Adapter` class. Adapters now extend `Aesthetic` instead of being passed to it through
  the constructor.
  - `Adapter#create` is now `Aesthetic#processStyleSheet`.
  - `Adapter#transform` is now `Aesthetic#transformToClassName`.
  - `Adapter#merge` has been removed, and now relies on
    [extend](https://github.com/justmoon/node-extend).
- Removed the `Aesthetic` option `defaultTheme`, use `theme` option instead.
- Removed the `ThemeProvider` component, use `theme` option instead.
- Removed the `createStyler` factory function.
  - Use `Aesthetic#withStyles` instead of `style`.
  - Use `Aesthetic#transformStyles` instead of `transform`.
- Removed the `withStyles` option `styleName`. Names are now generated with a unique ID.
- Removed the `withStyles` option `passThemeNameProp`. Access the current theme from `Aesthetic`
  options.
- Removed `createStyleElement` helper function.
- Removed `PropType`s exported from the index.
- Updated the `Aesthetic` option `pure` to be enabled by default.
- Updated `Aesthetic#registerTheme` and `Aesthetic#extendTheme` global styles to require a
  definition function that returns an object.
- Moved `Aesthetic#constructor` options to the 1st argument.
- Moved `Aesthetic#extendTheme` theme name to 1st argument, and parent theme name to 2nd argument
  (swapped positions).

**Unified Syntax**

- Unified syntax is now required and is the default syntax. Native adapter syntax is no longer
  supported.
- Dropped support for `@namespace` (was rarely supported by adapters).
- Dropped support for global at-rules being defined within a component style sheet (via
  `withStyles`). This includes `@charset`, `@import`, `@font-face`, `@global`, `@keyframes`,
  `@page`, and `@viewport`.
  - They must only be defined within the global style sheet when registering a theme.
  - Local `@keyframes` can be defined within a component by setting the keyframes object to
    `animationName`.
  - Local `@font-face` can be defined within a component by setting the font face object to
    `fontFamily`.
- Dropped support for local at-rules being defined within a global style sheet (via theme global
  styles). This includes `@fallbacks`, `@media`, `@supports`, and `@selectors`.
- Child combinators (`> li`), advanced pseudos (`:not(:nth-child(n))`), and advanced attributes
  (`[href*="foo"]`) must now be defined within the `@selectors` at-rule.

#### 🚀 Updates

**Core**

- Added `Aesthetic` option `theme` to denote the currently active theme.
- Added `Aesthetic#withTheme` HOC factory to gain access to the active theme object.
- DOM styles are now flushed on mount to properly support server-side rendering.
- Global styles now have access to the current theme object.

**Unified Syntax**

- Added new `@selectors` at-rule to support all advanced selectors.
- Updated `@page` to support `:left` and `:right` pseudos.
- Updated `animationName` property to support inline keyframes objects.
- Updated `fontFamily` property to support inline font face objects.
- Properly supports nested at-rules, like `@media` and `@supports`.

#### 🐞 Fixes

- Global theme styles will no longer collide with other themes.

#### 🛠 Internals

- Converted from Flow to TypeScript.

## 2.6.0 - 2018-07-11

### 2.2.1 - 2018-01-30

## 2.2.0 - 2018-01-13

#### 🚀 Updates

## 2.1.0 - 2018-01-03

#### 🚀 Updates

- Style names (usually the component name) are now passed to adapters during the style sheet
  creation phase.

# 2.0.0 - 2018-01-02

Aesthetic has been rewritten to properly support specificity, new at-rules, and global styles.
Styles are no longer transformed on mount and will now be transformed on render using a new style
sheet layer. Furthermore, unified syntax now supports most common at-rules, and a new `@font-face`
structure.

[View the migration guide!](https://github.com/milesj/aesthetic/blob/master/docs/migrate/2.0.md)

#### 💥 Breaking

- Requires IE 11+.

- Removed `aesthetic-utils` package (any remaining helpers were moved to core).
- Removed the `classes` function.
  - Use the `transform` function provided by `createStyler` instead.
- Removed `ClassNamesPropType` and `ClassOrStylesPropType` prop types.

  declarations.

  - The `style` function is an HOC factory and works like the original 1.0 return value.
  - The `transform` function is now required to generate class names from style declarations.
- Renamed the HOC `wrappedComponent` static property to `WrappedComponent`.
- Renamed the HOC `theme` prop (to toggle themes) to `themeName`.
- Inherited and parent styles are no longer passed as the HOC styler callback 2nd argument.
- Unified Syntax
  - The `@font-face` unified syntax rule has been rewritten to support multiple variations of the
    same font family.
    - The object key is now the font family name, instead of a random name.
    - The object value can now be an array of font face style declarations.
    - The `srcPaths` property, an array of paths, is now required (instead of `src`).

#### 🚀 Updates

- Added a new adapter, `TypeStyle`.
- Added `Aesthetic#createStyleSheet` for converting a component's styles into an adapter specific
  style sheet.
  - The component's current props are passed as the 2nd argument to the HOC styler callback.
  - Inherited and parent styles are now automatically deep merged when extending.
- Added `Adapter#create` for creating and adapting style sheets.

  - The previous `theme` prop was renamed to `themeName`.
  - The `Aesthetic` `themePropName` option now controls this new prop.
- Unified Syntax
  - Added new `@charset`, `@global`, `@import`, `@namespace`, `@page`, `@supports`, and `@viewport`
    at-rules (varies between adapters).
