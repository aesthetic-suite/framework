# 2.0.0
#### ðŸ’¥ Breaking
* The `@font-face` unified syntax rule has been rewritten to support multiple variations of the
  same font family.
  * The object key is now the font family name, instead of a random name.
  * The object value can now be an array of font face style declarations.
  * The `src` property must now be an array of paths (the `format()` is automatically added).
* The HOC `wrappedComponent` static property was renamed to `WrappedComponent`.
* The HOC `theme` prop (to toggle themes) was renamed to `themeName`.

#### ðŸš€ New
* Added `@supports` unified syntax support.
* Added a new adapter, `TypeStyle`.
* Added a new property `localAlias` for use within `@font-face` (the `local()` value).
* The current theme style declaration will be passed to styled components under the `theme` prop.
  * The previous `theme` prop was renamed to `themeName`.
  * The `Aesthetic` `themePropName` option now controls this new prop.
