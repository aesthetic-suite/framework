# 2.2.0
#### ðŸš€ New
* Unified Syntax
  * Attribute selectors are now supported when starting with `[`.
  * Direct descendant selectors are now supported with `>`.

# 2.1.0 - 01/03/18
#### ðŸš€ New
* Style names (usually the component name) are now passed to adapters during the stylesheet
  creation phase.

# 2.0.0 - 01/02/18
Aesthetic has been rewritten to properly support specificity, new at-rules, and global styles.
Styles are no longer transformed on mount and will now be transformed on render using a new
stylesheet layer. Furthermore, unified syntax now supports most common at-rules, and a new
`@font-face` structure.

[View the migration guide!](../../MIGRATE_2.0.md)

#### ðŸ’¥ Breaking
* Requires IE 11+.
* Requires `WeakMap` support.
* Removed React Native support (it was finicky and only supported by 1 adapter).
* Removed `aesthetic-utils` package (any remaining helpers were moved to core).
* Removed the `classes` function.
  * Use the `transform` function provided by `createStyler` instead.
* Removed `ClassNamesPropType` and `ClassOrStylesPropType` prop types.
  * Use the `StylesPropType` instead.
* Refactored `Aesthetic#transformStyles` and `Adapter#transform` to now require an array of style
  declarations.
  * Will now return a single combined class name for increased specificity.
* Refactored `createStyler` to return 2 functions, `style` and `transform`.
  * The `style` function is an HOC factory and works like the original 1.0 return value.
  * The `transform` function is now required to generate class names from style declarations.
* Renamed the HOC `wrappedComponent` static property to `WrappedComponent`.
* Renamed the HOC `theme` prop (to toggle themes) to `themeName`.
* Inherited and parent styles are no longer passed as the HOC styler callback 2nd argument.
* Unified Syntax
  * The `@font-face` unified syntax rule has been rewritten to support multiple variations of the
    same font family.
    * The object key is now the font family name, instead of a random name.
    * The object value can now be an array of font face style declarations.
    * The `srcPaths` property, an array of paths, is now required (instead of `src`).

#### ðŸš€ New
* Added a new adapter, `TypeStyle`.
* Added `Aesthetic#createStyleSheet` for converting a component's styles into an adapter
  specific stylesheet.
  * The component's current props are passed as the 2nd argument to the HOC styler callback.
  * Inherited and parent styles are now automatically deep merged when extending.
* Added `Adapter#create` for creating and adapting stylesheets.
* Updated `Aesthetic#registerTheme` to use the new global styles system.
* The current theme declarations will be passed to styled components under the `theme` prop.
  * The previous `theme` prop was renamed to `themeName`.
  * The `Aesthetic` `themePropName` option now controls this new prop.
* Unified Syntax
  * Added new `@charset`, `@global`, `@import`, `@namespace`, `@page`, `@supports`, and `@viewport`
    at-rules (varies between adapters).
  * Added a new property `local` for use within `@font-face` (the source `local()` value).
